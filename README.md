# Project Title

Brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Ruby version: 3.2.2
- Rails version: 7.0.8
- System dependencies

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### Backend Setup

1. **Install Ruby on Rails and Ruby**: Make sure you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions on the [Official Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).

2. **Install Gems**: Navigate to your Rails application directory and run:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

   This command installs all the gems listed in your Gemfile.

3. **Database Creation and Initialization**:

   - Migrate the database to create the necessary tables:

     ```bash
     rails active_storage:install
     rails db:migrate
     ```

#### Frontend Setup (Next.js Client)

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Packages**: Navigate to your Next.js project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all the packages listed in your `package.json` file.

3. **Run the Client**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the Next.js development server.
